[h1]Adds thoughtfully designed, fun and tricky challenges to The Binding Of Isaac[/h1]

[b]Current Challenges include:[/b]

- [b] ICU [/b] - Control a big tear in the darkness with a flashlight

- [b] Ring of smoke [/b] - Shoot bombs around you in a circle!

- [b] Hereeee's Isaac! [/b] - Control a knife around the room

- [b] ICU? - [/b] Similar to ICU - but without darkness and your tears are trickier to control

- [b] The Fidget Spinner [/b] - You cannot shoot, but you can use a spinning disk which spins itself and some flies that orbit you. You can also fly

- [b] Dr.Pills [/b] - Each run is based around getting as many pills as you can, they are all positive ones! So go wild!

- [b] Apollyon the Astrologer [/b] - Start off as Apollyon with a few astrology based items

- [b] Conjurer of Milk [/b] - Your body and mind are one with the power of electrified Milk!

[h2]I am already working on adding more challenges, please leave any suggestions in the comments! :)[/h2] </description>
